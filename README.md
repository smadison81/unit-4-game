<h1>Street Fighter RPG</h1>

Street Fighter RPG is a JQUery driven game that allows the player to pick his player and his opponent.  Each time the user presses attack, he randomly depletes the opponents hit points (hp) between 1 and 15.  At the same time the enemy counter attacks you for the same random hitpoints. Every round the users hitpoints multiply by 6.  The point of the game is deplete all your enemies hitpoints before you lose all your hitpoints.
